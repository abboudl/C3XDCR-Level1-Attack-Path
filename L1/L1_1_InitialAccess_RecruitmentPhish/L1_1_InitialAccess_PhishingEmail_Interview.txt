Subject: CanTel Unlimited - Account Executive Interview

Hi Tim,

After our conversation on Linkedin, I had a look at your resume and I think it's time we had an official interview.

There are two items in the following Goodle Drive link. The first is a full job description so you can learn more about the position. The second is a compensation schedule that lays out in detail how you will get compensated should you be offered the Account Executive position including your base salary, yearly bonuses, and the no-cap commission.

Zoom virtual room: https://us05web.zoom.us/j/6101664448?pwd=VlNEcWRgZGkydHhBTTJoRnJXYU9wQT09

Please let me know which one of these dates and time work for you:
- Wednesday, Nov 23, 2-3PM
- Wednesday, Nov 23, 3-4PM
- Thursday, Nov 24, 10-11AM

Finally, an important note: The attached Excel file is configured to retrieve compensation data from our central
database. In Excel, this is disabled by default. Before opening the file, open Excel, go into the 
"File" Menu. At the bottom left corner of the window, select "Options". Click "Trust Center" then 
"Trust Center Settings" and check the following options:
1. Enable Automatic Update of All Workbook Links
2. Enable Dynamic Data Exchange Server Launch

I look forward to our interview. 

Best,
